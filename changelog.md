## 2025-08-12 - Update 67

### Bug Fixes
- **Fullscreen Comparison Modal**: Fixed a bug where the fullscreen functionality for the comparison modal was not expanding correctly (only height, not width). This was resolved by applying the fullscreen class to the `compare-modal-overlay` and adjusting CSS to make the modal content fill the fullscreen overlay.
- **Comparison Modal Button Layout**: Repositioned the "Save Image" button next to the "Fullscreen" button in the modal header, ensuring both buttons auto-size to their content.

## 2025-08-12 - Update 66

## 2025-08-12 - Update 65

- **"Reset View" Button**: Fixed a bug where clicking the "Reset View" button would remove all names and break the "Show/Hide Names" toggle. The `reset-view` function now correctly resets all `appSettings` to their default values, including label visibility settings, and ensures the UI reflects this state.





## 2025-08-11 - Update 6

### Bug Fixes
- **Inner Planet Visibility**: Fixed an issue where Mercury and Venus were orbiting inside the Sun's visual radius.
  - Introduced a separate, smaller `sunVisualScale` to reduce the Sun's size, ensuring inner planet orbits are clearly visible.
  - Planets remain scaled realistically relative to each other, maintaining educational value while improving usability.
- **Shadow Calculation**: Corrected a bug in the moon shadow calculation that was using an outdated scaling factor for planet radii.

## 2025-08-11 - Update 5

### Refactor
- **Orbital Distance Scaling**: Refactored planetary distances to use Astronomical Units (AU).
  - Replaced hard-coded distance values with real-world data in AU for each planet.
  - Introduced an `AU` scaling constant to convert these values into scene units, making the data more maintainable and readable.
  - Updated all relevant logic (initial positioning, orbit drawing, and animation) to use the new scaled distances.

## 2025-08-11 - Update 4

### Refactor
- **Celestial Body Scaling**: Adjusted the scaling of the sun, planets, and moons to be relatively accurate.
  - Introduced a single `visualScale` factor to ensure all celestial bodies are sized in proportion to each other.
  - Corrected the radii of Mars's moons (Phobos and Deimos) to their actual values, and updated other moon radii for better precision.
  - Rescaled Saturn's rings to maintain their proportions relative to the newly scaled planet.
  - This change provides a more realistic and educational representation of the solar system.

## 2025-08-11 - Update 3

### Bug Fixes
- **Mercury Visibility Issue**: Fixed critical scaling problem where Mercury was not visible
  - Sun was rendered too large (695 units radius) relative to planetary distances
  - Mercury at distance 580 was effectively hidden inside the sun's visual sphere
  - Reduced sun size scaling from 1.0 to 0.2 (now 139 units radius)
  - Mercury and other inner planets are now clearly visible and navigable
  - Maintains realistic proportional relationships between celestial bodies

## 2025-08-11 - Update 2

### New Features
- **Enhanced Sun Visual Control**: Sun intensity slider now controls both lighting and the sun's visual brightness
  - Sun opacity and color intensity adjust dynamically with the slider
  - Realistic yellow-tinted brightness scaling for authentic solar appearance
  - Maintains lighting realism while providing visual feedback

- **Sun Rotation Animation**: Added realistic sun rotation
  - Sun rotates slower than planets (0.002 speed multiplier)
  - Rotation speed scales with orbit speed multiplier setting
  - Provides authentic celestial motion for educational accuracy

- **Save Current View**: New "Save Image" button in top-right interface
  - Captures current 3D view as high-quality PNG file
  - Automatic timestamp in filename (solar-system-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.png)
  - Preserves exact lighting, shadows, and positioning

- **Enhanced Planet Navigation**: Improved "Go To" button functionality
  - Consistent optimal zoom level based on planet size
  - Smart camera positioning with sun visible in background

  - Added moons for Earth (Moon), Mars (Phobos, Deimos), Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto), Saturn (Titan, Rhea), Uranus (Titania, Oberon), and Neptune (Triton)
  - Moons orbit their parent planets with realistic orbital periods and distances
  - Moons use actual moon texture from textures/moon.jpg

  - Moons darken significantly when their parent planet blocks sunlight (eclipse effect)
  - Shadow intensity reduces moon brightness to 15% during eclipse for realistic lunar eclipse appearance
  - Real-time shadow calculations using angular separation and planetary shadow cone geometry
  - Accounts for distance relationships between sun, planet, and moon positions

## v1.1.31 (2025-08-20)

### Bug Fixes
- Help button now displays the Help panel by adding a `#help-panel.visible` rule and wiring it to the existing JS toggle.
- Footer (version) now visible above the canvas; converted to fixed-position with z-index and styled background to ensure readability.
- Loading overlay now has a proper panel background and subtle animation for steps; previously only text showed with no styling.

### Implementation Notes
- CSS: updates in `public/styles.css` for `#help-panel.visible`, `#loading-overlay`, `.loading-content`, and loading step animations.
- HTML: minor footer container style adjustments in `public/index.html` (fixed positioning, z-index, and contrast).
- Version: bumped to `v1.1.31` (package.json and public/version.js).

#### Documentation Update (same day)
- Refined release notes and expanded README to clearly call out Help panel visibility, Loading overlay styling, and Footer visibility improvements introduced in v1.1.31.

##### Additional Docs (same day, follow-up)
- Added troubleshooting notes for common build/run issues (empty `dist` after clean → run build; port 3022 in use; Node not found).
- Clarified how the version footer is populated via `public/version.js` and kept in sync with `package.json`.
